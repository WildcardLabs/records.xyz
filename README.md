🎯  **One payment link for all your wallets.**

💡  You create everywhere, but getting paid shouldn’t be a scavenger hunt. Share your link, and we’ll make sure your digital dollars land in the right wallets, on the right apps.

### **What is Records.xyz?**  

**Records.xyz** gives creators a **single, shareable payment page** that unifies all your app wallets and digital personas.  

Fans, collaborators, or clients often don’t know which wallet to pay. We solve this by giving you:  

- 🌟 **One link for all your wallets**  
- 💸 **Automatic splits** — route payments to the app wallets you choose  
- 🖼️ **Shareable page** — QR code, balances, and routing info for anyone to pay  
- 🔗 **Quick onboarding** — generate your subdomain from your social username  

Think of it like a **Linktree for payments**, but smarter: handling split identities and app wallets automatically.

---
### **How It Works**  

1. **Login with Social**  
   Fast onboarding via socials. Your social username helps generate your personal payment page instantly. 

2. **Your Personal Payment Page**  
   Your page (e.g., alice.records.xyz) is ready to share — a single link anyone can use to send you digital dollars.
⚡ Bonus: This subdomain also acts as the primary ENS name of your routing contract, so all transactions are visible and named on block explorers.
3. **Link Your Wallets**  
   Add your app wallets, smart accounts, or EOAs. Decide how your digital dollars should be split across them.

4. **Share & Get Paid**  
   Copy your link or QR code, share it anywhere. Payments automatically flow to your selected wallets, keeping your split personas unified.
