🎯  **One payment link for all your wallets.**

💡  You create everywhere, but getting paid shouldn’t be a scavenger hunt. Share your link, and we’ll make sure your digital dollars land in the right wallets, on the right apps.

## **What is Records.xyz?**  

**Records.xyz** gives creators a **single, shareable payment page** that unifies all your app wallets and digital personas.  

Fans, collaborators, or clients often don’t know which wallet to pay. We solve this by giving you:  

- 🌟 **One link for all your wallets**  
- 💸 **Automatic splits** — route payments to the app wallets you choose  
- 🖼️ **Shareable page** — QR code, balances, and routing info for anyone to pay  
- 🔗 **Quick onboarding** — generate your subdomain from your social username  

Think of it like a **Linktree for payments**, but smarter: handling split identities and app wallets automatically.

---
## **How It Works**  

1. **Login with Social**  
   Fast onboarding via socials — your username auto-generates your subdomain page.  

2. **Get Your Personal Page**  
   Your `*.records.xyz` page is **also the primary ENS name of your routing contract** — visible on block explorers.  

3. **Link Your Wallets**  
   Add EOAs, smart accounts, or app wallets. Configure splits so payments reach the right wallets.  

4. **Share & Get Paid**  
   Copy your link or QR code. Fans, collaborators, or anyone can pay you — digital dollars automatically route and split across your wallets.
